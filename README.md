# PyQtcumber
A simple library for handling your graphical editor needs.   Supports pickling even of signals / slots using dill.

Spend weeks debugging your custom QGraphicsScene items?  No more!   Here's a beta version for you to test.

I'm thinking within your project's folder, you want to clone this repository into its own subfolder and pull to there any bug fixes.
